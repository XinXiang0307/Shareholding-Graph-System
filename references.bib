abstract = {Knowledge graphs are widely used in industry and studied within the academic community. However, the models applied in the development of knowledge graphs vary. Analysing and providing a synthesis of the commonly used approaches to knowledge graph development would provide researchers and practitioners a better understanding of the overall process and methods involved. Hence, this article aims at defining the overall process of knowledge graph development and its key constituent steps. For this purpose, a systematic review and a conceptual analysis of the literature was conducted. The resulting process was compared to case studies to evaluate its applicability. The proposed process suggests a unified approach and provides guidance for both researchers and practitioners when constructing and managing knowledge graphs.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development and improvement of modern surveying and remote-sensing technology, data in the fields of surveying and remote sensing have grown rapidly. Due to the characteristics of large-scale, heterogeneous and diverse surveys and the loose organization of surveying and remote-sensing data, effectively obtaining information and knowledge from data can be difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of using ontology for heterogeneous data integration. Based on the heterogeneous, decentralized, and dynamic updates of large surveying and remote-sensing data, this paper constructs a knowledge graph for surveying and remote-sensing applications. First, data are extracted. Second, using the ontology editing tool Protégé, a knowledge graph mode level is constructed. Then, using a relational database, data are stored, and a D2RQ tool maps the data from the mode level’s ontology to the data layer. Then, using the D2RQ tool, a SPARQL protocol and resource description framework query language (SPARQL) endpoint service is used to describe functions such as query and reasoning of the knowledge graph. The graph database is then used to display the knowledge graph. Finally, the knowledge graph is used to describe the correlation between the fields of surveying and remote sensing.},

abstract = {Dianrong, a tech-driven internet finance company, provides loans to a large number of people and small business users. The ability to predict fraud from loan applications is key to the company's business. Based on published literature on fraud detection techniques, features have to be extracted manually for further rule design or machine learning. But as fraudulent behaviors change over time to avoid detection, simple features or rules become obsolete quickly. Normally, we have to extract hundreds of features, which is a time and resource consuming process. This paper proposes a new way to extract features automatically from a borrower's phone network graph using neural networks, which not only overcomes the above issue, but also captures features that are hard to fake. This method has yielded strong results in reality.},

abstract = {The frequent occurrence of financial fraud caused by listed companies has seriously hindered the healthy development of the capital market. Existing studies usually analyze financial fraud through the effectiveness of audit opinion or the correlation between auditor change rate and financial fraud, ignoring the relationship between different participants. By using the audit relationships among corporations, audit firms and auditors, this paper constructs an audit information knowledge graph and proposes a knowledge graph reasoning framework based on the Sub Feature Extraction method to detect potential fraud corporations. In the process of analyzing the audit data of 376 companies in the China Growth Enterprises Market from 2013 to 2019, it is found that potential fraud corporations can be well identified by searching from the known fraud corporations using searched paths. In addition, we find two new audit features of financial fraud corporations which are respectively related to abnormal audit opinions issued by auditors and abnormal associations of audit firms. They can help regulators more effectively find the potential financial fraud corporations that need to be supervised.}
